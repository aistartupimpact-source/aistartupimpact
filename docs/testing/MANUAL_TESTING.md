## Tips for Interns

1. **Always take screenshots** of failures — annotate what's wrong
2. **Note the exact URL** where the issue occurs
3. **Record the steps exactly** — someone else needs to reproduce it
4. **Check both themes** (light + dark) for visual issues
5. **Test on mobile first** — most bugs hide on small screens
6. **Clear cache** between testing sessions (Cmd+Shift+R)
7. **Don't skip "expected" results** — verify every assertion
8. **Report ALL issues**, even if you think they're minor
9. **If something feels wrong**, it probably is — document it
10. **Ask if blocked** — don't waste time on environment issues
