          Welcome to AI Startup Impact. This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>AI Startup Impact</strong> (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, &quot;us&quot;) collects, uses, stores, and protects the personal data of users (&quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot;) when you use our website, newsletters, directories, event platform, job board, and related services (collectively, the &quot;Services&quot;).
        </p>
        <p>
          We are committed to protecting your personal data in accordance with the <strong>Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)</strong> and the rules made thereunder, to the extent they are in force at the relevant time. As the DPDPA framework is being implemented in phases, we will update this policy as additional provisions come into effect. This policy also reflects our voluntary adoption of privacy best practices.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          Our Services are intended for persons aged <strong>18 years and above</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 18 years of age. This age restriction is our operational policy; we recognise that the DPDPA defines &quot;child&quot; as a person below 18 years and imposes specific obligations regarding children&apos;s data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we become aware that we have collected data from a person under 18 without verifiable parental or guardian consent, we will delete such data promptly. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal data to us, please contact us at privacy@aistartupimpact.com.
        </p>
